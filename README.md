## Stephanie Pocci & Dania Nasereddin
### Description
Utilizing [research data collected from university students](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shariful07/student-mental-health), we performed a data science analysis on the effects on students' mental health based on their CGPA (Cumulative Grade point average).
<p> In this analysis we will identify possible correlations or causations in the dataset regarding the wellness of university students' mental health in correspondance with their CGPA.</p>
